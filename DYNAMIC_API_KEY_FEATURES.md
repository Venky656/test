# Dynamic API Key Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

The Resume Generator now fully supports **dynamic API key usage**, where each user provides their own Google Gemini API key through the frontend form. This ensures privacy, security, and scalability.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced API Key Input Field** (`public/index.html`)
   - Added pattern validation (`AI[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{35,}`)
   - Improved placeholder text and help information
   - Added toggle visibility functionality
   - Enhanced error messaging

2. **Client-Side Validation** (`public/script.js`)
   - Validates API key format before sending request
   - Checks for proper "AI" prefix and minimum length
   - Provides helpful error messages with links to get API key
   - Strips API key from resume data before sending to backend

3. **API Key Transmission**
   - Sends API key via `X-API-Key` header (not in request body)
   - API key is used only for the current session
   - Never stored locally or on server

### Backend Changes

1. **Dynamic API Initialization** (`server.js`)
   - Removed global Gemini AI initialization
   - Creates new GoogleGenerativeAI instance per request
   - Uses API key from request header

2. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Server-side API key format validation
   - Better error messages for invalid keys
   - Graceful handling of API errors

3. **Security Features**
   - API key is never logged or stored
   - Immediate validation prevents unnecessary API calls
   - Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## 🔑 API Key Flow

```
User Input → Frontend Validation → HTTP Header → Server Validation → Gemini API Call
```

1. User enters API key in form
2. Frontend validates format (starts with "AI", min 30 chars)
3. API key sent in `X-API-Key` header
4. Server validates and creates dynamic Gemini instance
5. API call made with user's key
6. Response processed and returned

## ✅ Benefits

- **Privacy**: No server-side API key storage
- **Security**: Each user manages their own access
- **Scalability**: No shared rate limits
- **Flexibility**: Users can use their own quota
- **Transparency**: Clear about data usage

## 🧪 Testing

Test the functionality with:

```bash
# Test API key validation
node test-api.js YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

# Start the application
npm start
```

## 📝 User Experience

1. User visits the application
2. Enters their Google Gemini API key (with helpful guidance)
3. Fills out resume information
4. Clicks "Generate Resume"
5. AI generates LaTeX using their API key
6. PDF is compiled and available for download

## 🔒 Privacy Guarantees

- ✅ API keys are never stored on the server
- ✅ API keys are never logged or cached
- ✅ Each session uses the user's own API quota
- ✅ No cross-user data contamination
- ✅ Full user control over their API usage

## 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with comprehensive API key setup guide
- Added test script for API key validation
- Enhanced error messages throughout the application
- Clear instructions for getting free API keys

This implementation ensures that the Resume Generator is both powerful and privacy-respecting, allowing users to leverage AI capabilities while maintaining full control over their API access.
